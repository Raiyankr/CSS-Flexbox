## Introduction

Flexible Box Layout or often known as FlexBox, is a CSS layout model that allows us to organize our website in a simple yet effective way. Before this layout was introduced to CSS, there were four other layout modes, that includes:
-	Inline: To organize texts in our webpage
-	Table: To organize in a 2D-grid based system
-	Block: To organize grouped or sections of our webpage
-	Positioned: To mentioned specific position for items. 

These four layout modes required lots of code to do some simple tasks like ‚ÄúCentering a div‚Äù. This is where FlexBox comes in clutch! This not only made coding easier but also opened CSS Webpage-organization to a whole new level.

## How to use FlexBox?

There are two things we need to understand in order to use FlexBox. 
- Flex Container: This container will contain some items from our webpage. This container will also define the organization property of the items combined.
- Flex Item: These can be individual components in our webpage (anywhere from a div, to a nested div).

We can create a Flex Container by using the _Displat: Flex_ property. This simply makes our container *Flex üí™üèª*.
