## Introduction

Flexible Box Layout or often known as FlexBox, is a CSS layout model that allows us to organize our website in a simple yet effective way. Before this layout was introduced to CSS, there were four other layout modes, that includes:
-	Inline: To organize texts in our webpage
-	Table: To organize in a 2D-grid based system
-	Block: To organize grouped or sections of our webpage
-	Positioned: To mentioned specific position for items. 

These four layout modes required lots of code to do some simple tasks like “Centering a div”. This is where FlexBox comes in clutch! This not only made coding easier but also opened CSS Webpage-organization to a whole new level.
